# School District Performance Analysis

## Overview
As the newly appointed Chief Data Scientist for our city's school district, my primary responsibility is to assist the school board and the mayor in making strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities. This project involves the analysis of district-wide standardized test results to uncover key trends and insights about school performance.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to aggregate and analyze student performance data across all schools in the district. By exploring various metrics such as math and reading scores and school-specific information, we aim to identify trends in school performance that can help guide decision-making for the district.

## Data
The dataset contains the following information:
- **Student Scores**: Math and Reading standardized test results for every student.
- **School Information**: Details regarding the schools that students attend, including location, size, and type (public/private).
- **Additional Metrics**: Any relevant demographic or funding information that can affect school performance.

## Tasks
1. **Data Aggregation**: Combine student performance data with school-specific information.
2. **Trend Identification**: Analyze key metrics to uncover trends in school performance, including:
   - Overall district-wide performance.
   - Comparison between schools.
   - Performance based on school size, type, and funding.
3. **Insights Generation**: Provide insights and recommendations based on the aggregated data.

## Analysis Approach
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understand the structure and key characteristics of the dataset.
- **Data Visualization**: Use visual tools to illustrate trends and compare school performance metrics.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Apply relevant statistical methods to highlight significant trends in performance.
  
## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: For data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
- **Pandas**: For efficient data handling and aggregation.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating meaningful visualizations of the data.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For an interactive analysis environment.

## Expected Outcomes
By the end of this project, we aim to deliver:
- A descriptive report showcasing district-wide trends in standardized test scores.
- A comparison of performance across schools with potential insights into the factors driving these trends.
- Strategic recommendations to assist in decision-making regarding school budgets and priorities.
